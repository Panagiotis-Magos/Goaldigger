Should probably store changes, todo stuff etc here, maybe make a new todo file. Seperate major fixes with lines

Back button fix 

fixed the back buttons, using a universal back button. The key thing here is not the screen with the back button but the previous screen.
The app keeps track of screens with a stack. In order to make the previous screen refresh,
you make it wait for the screen on top of it in the stack, and storing the result in a variable,
and you then refresh based on that. for example 

                onPressed: () async {
                   final shouldRefresh = await Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/profile');
                    if (shouldRefresh == true && mounted) {
                      print("should refresh");
                      setState(() {}); // Trigger home screen refresh
                    }
                }
This goes from the home to the profile screen. It pushes the profile screen to stack. It now waits for the Navigator
to return from there, and what message that sends (by default the back button sends Navigator.pop(context,true))
Then, if the pop returned true, the page refreshes. Note that from my understanding, you can put more screens on
the stack and it works properly (using push) but pushReplace with the screen just above does not 
work for whatever reason (the issue probably is that it waits from the screen right over it).
